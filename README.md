# Binary-Search-Tree

Project Completion Date: October 2020

In this project we implement a Binary Search Tree, where each node is a rectangle object with a name and its dimensions.
 
The goal of this project is to learn to manipulate the tree by inserting, removing, finding relevant nodes.

Project done as a requirement for Virginia Tech Course CS5040: Intermediate Data Structures & Algorithms.
